# Prepend a new version entry to changelog.md SAFELY — the mechanical fix for
# the recurring "overwrite-prepend" mistake (a hand-edit that replaces the top
# `### vX.Y.Z` header instead of inserting above it, orphaning that version's
# bullets under the new entry; see .pre-commit-scripts/check_changelog_headers.sh
# and .claude/rules/changelog-entries.md).
#
# It NEVER edits an existing header: the new block is spliced in immediately
# BEFORE the first `### vX.Y.Z` line, so every prior header is only shifted down.
# That makes the overwrite bug structurally impossible — which a careless Edit
# can't promise.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/changelog-add.sh <version> [date] <<'EOF'
#   - **Headline.** Body of the entry (one or more bullets / lines).
#   EOF
#
#   <version>  e.g. v0.1.107 (a leading 'v' is added if you omit it)
#   [date]     optional; defaults to today as "Dth Month YYYY" (e.g. "20th June
#              2026"), matching the existing entries. Forced to the C locale so
#              the month name is English regardless of the shell locale.
#   body       read from stdin (heredoc or a pipe). Required, non-empty.
#
#   -f, --file PATH   changelog to edit (default: ./changelog.md)
#
# Wrong-repo guard: when -f/--file is omitted, the default './changelog.md'
# is resolved against the CWD, and the script then refuses to run unless
# that directory's manifest (pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / build.gradle.kts
# / package.json) is already AT the <version> you're adding — the normal
# workflow bumps the manifest before adding the changelog entry. This turns
# "wrong repo's changelog" from a silent write into a refusal. Pass -f/--file
# explicitly (this always skips the check) when editing a changelog outside
# the CWD's own tree, e.g. from another repo's shell.
#
# The body is inserted verbatim — write it exactly as it should appear
# (leading "- " bullets, wrapped lines, etc.). The version you pass should match
# the manifest bump in the same commit; the `check-version-changelog` guard
# enforces that at commit time.
#
# NOTE: this always writes a "### vX.Y.Z - date" header — it is built for
# version-numbered changelogs. A changelog that has moved to plain-date
# headers with no version number at all (e.g. shakespeare's, for recent
# entries) will still get a versioned header spliced in at the now-correct
# top position, which won't match the surrounding entries' format. For a
# changelog like that, hand-edit instead — see the "If the script isn't
# present, or you must hand-edit anyway" section of the global
# changelog-entries.md rule, anchoring the edit on the title line.
