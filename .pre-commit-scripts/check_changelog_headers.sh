# Pre-commit hook: block changelog prepends that destroy an existing
# version header.
#
# The failure this guards against: a "prepend" that overwrites the top
# `### vX.Y.Z` header with the new entry instead of inserting a new
# block above it — the old header is deleted and its bullets are
# orphaned under the new entry.
#
# A header *removal* is legitimate only when the same version is
# re-added elsewhere in the same commit (rotation into
# `changelog/YYYY.md`, or a header reformat/typo-fix). So the check
# fails only when a version's header is removed and *not* re-added
# anywhere in the staged changelog diff.
#
# Pure bash + git/grep — no Python — so it drops into any repo (Rust,
# Kotlin, Svelte, …) without pulling in a language runtime.
#
# The pathspec is depth-agnostic (`*changelog.md` / `*changelog/*.md`):
# it covers a flat repo's root `changelog.md` plus its `changelog/`
# archive AND every subproject `changelog.md` in a monorepo (e.g.
# `agents7_ui/changelog.md`), so a single root-level hook guards them
# all.

This is the overwrite-prepend bug: a new entry replaced an existing
'### vX.Y.Z' header instead of being inserted above it, orphaning that
entry's bullets. Insert the new entry in the blank gap above the current
top header — never edit or replace the header line itself.
(If you genuinely renamed a header's version, re-stage so both the old
and new versions appear in the diff.)
